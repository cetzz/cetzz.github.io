    cellphone support.<br>
    <br>

    support.<br>
    Right now it's in a <b style='color:red; font-weight:bold;'>WIP</b> state, but the idea is to make it an online game eventually.<br><br> </p>
<h3>CSS drawings, animations and design</h3>
<p>
    <a href='/CSSIllustrations/minecraftbee.html'>Minecraft Bee</a><br>
    The bee will follow your mouse (or finger if in mobile) while it flies!<br>
    Minecraft Bee is a proyect made in js, CSS and Bootstrap. It's fully responsive and it has cellphone support.<br><br>
    <a href='/CSSIllustrations/finn.html'>Finn the Human</a><br>
    Finn the Human is a character from Adventure time.<br>
    This is a minimalist drawing of Finn the Human. It was made in Bootstrap and CSS. It wasn't made to be responsive,
    so it fails sometimes. Most of the times it is okay.<br><br>
</p>
<h3>Projects that need a server</h3>
<p>
GitHub sites does NOT provide a XAMP server, so these proyects cannot be seen here. You need to install them to check them out, feel free to do so!<br><br>
    <b style='font-weight:bold'>SWAPI Clone</b><br>
    Search for starship and vehicles from the popular franchise Star Wars!<br><br>
    SWAPI Clone is a project divided in two parts.
    <br>The front-end is nothing special, as it was made to showcase the API, but it has some nice and intuitive UX
    design, and it's fully responsive as well. Read the documentation <a href='https://github.com/cetzz/SWAPICLONE_Front'>here</a>.
    <br>The API is pretty cool though, read the documentation for the Rest API <a
        href='https://github.com/cetzz/test_LN'>here</a>! <br><br>
    The front-end part uses a little bit of PHP, js, jQuery and css .<br>
    The Rest API uses PHP 7.3 with the framework Slim 3. This part uses a relational database, so a XAMP server is
    required for it to work.
