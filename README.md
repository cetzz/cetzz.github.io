                    Right now it's in a WIP state, but the idea is to make it an online game eventually.<br><br> </p>
                <h3>CSS drawings, animations and design</h3>
                   <p>
                    <a href='/CSSIllustrations/minecraftbee.html'>Minecraft Bee</a><br>
                    The bee will follow your mouse (or finger if in mobile) while it flies!<br>
                    Minecraft Bee is a proyect made in js and CSS. It's fully responsive and it has cellphone support.<br><br>
                    <a href='/CSSIllustrations/finn.html'>Finn the Human</a><br>
                    Finn the human is a character from Adventure time.<br>
                    This is a minimalist drawing of Finn the Human. It was made in Bootstrap and CSS. It wasn't made to be responsive, so it fails sometimes. Most of the times it  is okay.<br><br> 
                   </p>
                <h3>Projects that need a server</h3>
                   <p>
                    <a href='/CSSIllustrations/minecraftbee.html'>SWAPI Clone</a><br>
                    Search for starship and vehicles from the popular franchise Star Wars!<br>
                    SWAPI Clone is a project divided in two parts. The front-end is nothing special, as it was made to showcase the API, but it has some nice and intuitive UX design. The API is pretty cool, read the documentation for the Rest API <a href='https://github.com/cetzz/test_LN'>here</a>. <br><br>!  <br>
                    The front-end part uses js, jQuery and css .<br>
                    The Rest API uses PHP 7.3 with the framework Slim 3. This part uses a relational database, so a XAMP server is required for it to work.
